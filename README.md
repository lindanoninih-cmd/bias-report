 # Bias & Fairness Analysis in Employment Data

## Overview

This project explores **bias and fairness in a synthetic employment dataset** using Python. It focuses on identifying disparities (e.g., gender-based) and evaluating fairness using metrics and visualizations.

## Objectives

* Analyze potential bias in employment data
* Apply fairness metrics
* Visualize disparities
* Demonstrate basic bias mitigation strategies

## Files

```
new_employment.ipynb   # Main analysis notebook
README.md              # Project summary
```

## Tools Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Fairness metrics

## Key Concepts

* Salary and outcome disparities
* Fairness metrics (e.g., statistical parity, disparate impact)
* Ethical implications of biased AI systems

## How to Run

1. Open `new_employment.ipynb`
2. Run all cells in order

## Notes

* Dataset is **synthetic** and for **educational purposes only**
* Project aligns with **Responsible / Ethical AI principles**


⭐ Suitable for coursework, bias audits, and beginner AI fairness projects
